/**
 * Phase 0 backfill: derive the category extension tables and the new

 *
 * Why this is a backfill and not part of the product seeder
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * The extension tables (`ProductStay`, `ProductFlight`, `ProductSailing`,
 * `ProductVehicle`) hold *structure* that the flat display columns on `Product`
 * never had — a hotel needs a stay range and a room grid, a flight needs ordered
 * segments. None of that can be invented from `roomCategory = "Deluxe suite"`,
 * so this file can only carry the data across, not invent it. It upgrades an
 * existing database in place instead of demanding a destructive `db:reset`.
 *
 * What it is honest about
 * ----------------------
 * Several values here are *defaults shaped like real data*, not facts pulled
 * from a supplier feed. That is deliberate and flagged inline. A demo database
 * gets a coherent, queryable shape; a production integration overwrites every
 * one of these from its source. Do not read `"Business"` as a claim about an
 * actual fare.
 *
 * Idempotent: extension writes skip products that already have a row, and the
 * search facets are refreshed from `Product` (the display source of truth) on
 * every run.

 * A deterministic demo schedule for a connecting route the table does not name.

 * connecting products (`HKG→DXB→LAX`, `SIN→DXB→LAX`, `LAX→DXB→JFK`) were seeded
 * with **null** leg times, and because `withinLayoverBounds` deliberately passes
 * an itinerary whose gap cannot be computed, those three survived a filter that
 * asked for a one-minute maximum layover. A shopper asking for a tight
 * connection was shown an itinerary of unknown length.
 *
 * So every connecting itinerary gets times. This is demo inventory in exactly
 * the sense the table already documents — the operator name, route and fare are
 * all illustrative — and a coherent schedule is what makes the layover filters
 * answerable. The alternative on record was to leave the times null and let the
 * filter abstain, which is the behaviour that produced the bug.
 *
 * Deterministic on the route string, so re-seeding produces byte-identical rows
 * and the data does not reshuffle between runs (`hash()` in `seed-global.ts`
 * exists for the same reason). The layover is the same 3h25m the hand-written
 * table uses, so the two sources are indistinguishable to a consumer.
