 * Two layers, composed here:
 *
 *   - `FEATURED_PRODUCTS` (below) — hand-authored entries for specific,
 *     named landmarks. These carry real place names, researched pricing and
 *     individually written reviews, so they are what a shopper sees at the
 *     top of a city rail.
 *   - `buildGlobalProducts()` — a full six-category catalogue generated for
 *     every city in the catalogue (see `seed-global.ts`), guaranteeing that no
 *     destination is ever empty and that flights, hotels and cruises exist
 *     everywhere, not just in the Western European cities that had data before.
 *
 * A hand-authored entry always wins over a generated one for the same slug, so
 * the richer copy is never overwritten by a template.
 */

/**
 * Hand-authored listings for specific, named landmarks.
 *
 * Exported so tooling can audit the artwork independently: these entries carry
 * individually chosen photographs, which makes them the one place duplication
 * could still enter the catalogue. `pnpm check:media` reads them through
 * `PRODUCTS` and fails if any photograph is used twice.

/**
 * Gives every hand-authored product a gallery with no repeated photograph.

 * The generated catalogue is unique by construction (`claimImage`). The authored
 * entries are not: their pictures were chosen one at a time over a long period,
 * the same few frames were reused across products, and two entries ended up
 * carrying one image twice. A shopper sees that as carelessness, and they are
 * right to.
 *
 * Repairing the nine offending slots by hand would leave the trap in place for
 * the next edit, so the rule is enforced instead: the first use of a picture is
 * kept — it is usually the one that actually shows the landmark — and any later
 * use is swapped for the next unused photograph **of the same city**. A gallery
 * slot that would have repeated something else becomes a picture of the right
 * place, which is strictly better than what it replaces.
 *
 * If a city has no imagery left the slot is dropped rather than repeated: a
 * product with two distinct photographs is not a defect, two identical ones is.
