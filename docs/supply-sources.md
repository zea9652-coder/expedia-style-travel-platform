# Supply sources

Registry for a first-party supply network: real geography and product identity
from open datasets, prices/availability synthesised by the pricing and inventory
engines. Booking reads only the canonical tables (`Product` / `TicketType` /
`InventoryRecord`) and never knows which source wrote a row.

`origin` maps to `InventorySource` (`PLATFORM` | `MERCHANT_FEED` | `MANUAL`) plus
the two added by this registry (`OPEN_DATASET`, `SYNTHETIC`).

## Implemented

`ourairports` is wired up. Everything else below is a candidate.

```bash
pnpm supply:import                      # full import, ~4,000 airports
pnpm --filter @easytrip/api supply:import -- --limit=500   # smoke run
```

| piece | where |
| --- | --- |
| adapter | `apps/api/src/modules/supply/ourairports.ts` |
| import job | `apps/api/src/modules/supply/import.ts` |
| CLI | `apps/api/prisma/supply-import.ts` |
| provenance | `SupplySourceRecord` (schema) |
| airport directory | `Destination` rows at `level = AIRPORT` |
| read API | `GET /api/v1/search/airports`, `GET /api/v1/search/airports/:iata/source` |

The import is idempotent: airports upsert on `iataCode` and provenance upserts on
`(sourceId, externalId)`, so a monthly refresh updates rows in place. It never
writes price or stock — those belong to `modules/pricing` and `modules/inventory`,
and an import that set them would silently override the pricing engine.

Imported airports are what make connection search useful beyond the hubs the
platform happens to sell: `/search/connections` can now be asked about an airport
with no inventory of its own.

## Origin semantics

| origin | written by | `ProductContract.commissionBps` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPEN_DATASET` | import job from the table above | `0` (platform sells as principal) |
| `SYNTHETIC` | pricing + inventory engines | `0` |
| `PLATFORM` | in-repo seed | `0` |
| `MERCHANT_FEED` | external partner feed | from feed |

## Rules

- **`openflights-routes` is forbidden. Do not write an adapter for it.**
  Upstream states in its own `data.php`: *"The third-party that OpenFlights uses
  for route data ceased providing updates in June 2014. The current data is of
  historical value only."* The upstream was one person's server; it died, and
  OpenFlights has had no route updates since. The toolchain is still Python 2.
  `airports.dat` / `airlines.dat` *are* still refreshed — only `routes.dat` is
  dead — but a schedule without routes is not a schedule.

- **Never import a dataset whose freshness you have not verified against the
  source itself.** A "static" note in this table is not evidence. Read the
  upstream README, the file's last commit, or a freshness field. This rule
  exists because a route adapter was written against exactly that dataset before
  its deprecation notice was read.

- **Schedule, fare and seat inventory cannot come from open data at all.** They
  are regulated commercial assets airlines distribute through GDS/NDC partners;
  there is no free, licence-clean, commercially redistributable source. The
  architecture assumes this — `SupplyOrigin` carries `MERCHANT_FEED` and
  `SYNTHETIC`, and every open-data adapter returns `[]` from `getRates()` /
  `getAvailability()` with a comment saying the pricing and inventory engines
  derive those instead.

- `origin` is written at sync time and is queryable; it is never inferred at read time.
- Prices and availability are never imported — only identity and geometry. They are
  derived by `modules/pricing` and `modules/inventory`.
- A source's `license` is stored alongside its rows so attribution can be produced
  from data, not from memory.
- ODbL (OSM, OpenFlights) is share-alike: derived database must be redistributed
  under ODbL. Prefer Overture / FSQ / OurAirports where a permissive license fits.

## Real-time sources

A second kind of source, deliberately separate from the import registry above:
live query APIs that answer "where is this aircraft right now" and **never write
a row**. Positions are seconds-fresh and ephemeral — they live in a 30s Redis
cache and nowhere else, so no Prisma model, no seed, and no provenance table is
involved. Because nothing is stored or redistributed, upstream licence terms are
consumed transiently; **verify a source's terms before ever persisting or
redistributing its data.**

Adapter: `apps/api/src/modules/supply/realtime-flight.ts` (enumerated chain,
first source that answers wins, per-source failure falls through, all sources
down → 503). Read API: `GET /api/v1/search/flights/live?lat=&lng=&radiusNm=`
and `GET /api/v1/search/flights/:callsign/live`.

Every source below was probed live on **2026-10-04** before being wired in,
per the freshness rule above.

| id | data | endpoint | auth | verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `adsb-lol` | live ADS-B positions, registration, type, squawk | `api.adsb.lol/v2/callsign/{cs}`, `/v2/point/{lat}/{lon}/{radiusNm≤250}` | none | `/v2/point/51.47/-0.45/20` → 200, 9 aircraft, 6 with callsigns. `/v2/route/…` → **503** |
| `opensky-network` | live ADS-B state vectors | `opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=…` (bbox) | none (anonymous quota) | HTTP 200, fresh bbox traffic; **fallback only** |
| `adsbdb` | registration → aircraft type, owner, photo | `api.adsbdb.com/v0/aircraft/{reg}` | none | HTTP 200 (`G-XLEA` → A380-841, British Airways). **Not usable for catalogue content** — see below |

Evaluated and **not** wired:

- `airplanes.live` — HTTP 403; access requires emailing them a project
  description first. Revisit if a second radius source is ever needed.
- `aviationstack` — alive but key-gated; the free tier is too small to be a
  dependable fallback.

## Live rate sources (commercial terms)

A third kind of source: **paid inventory and rates**. Adapter chain lives in
`apps/api/src/modules/supply/live-adapters.ts`, contract in
`modules/supply/live.ts`, and search consumes it via `applyLiveRates` in
`modules/search/service.ts`.

Every endpoint below was probed with `curl` on **2026-10-05**. The responses are
quoted verbatim because the difference between them is the whole story:

| id | endpoint | probed response | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kiwi.tequila` | `tequila-api.kiwi.com/v2/search?fly_from=SFO` | `403 {"error_code":403,"message":"'apikey' header is required"}` | **Alive, credential enforced.** Partner registration is by email magic link, not self-service |
| `amadeus` | `api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token` | `200` + `{"errorCode":"15","description":"This request was blocked by our security service"}` | Endpoint exists, but the **self-service portal was decommissioned 2025-07-17**; access is now an enterprise sales agreement |
| `kiwi.v2` | `api.kiwi.com/v2/search` | `Could not resolve host` | No such hostname — the v2 API is not served there |
| `serpapi` | `serpapi.com/search?engine=google_flights&api_key=test` | `401 {"error":"Invalid API key…"}` | Alive, key-gated. Configured but **not wired** — see below |

### What `kiwi.tequila` does and does not do

Wired as the first adapter in the chain. It is a **metasearch aggregator**: its
prices are what Kiwi found across the OTA landscape, not stock this platform
holds. Three limits are load-bearing and must not be quietly dropped:

- **No availability.** Tequila publishes no per-date allotment, so
  `getAvailability` returns `[]` by design. `InventoryRecord` and
  `InventoryHold` remain the only authority on sellability. Inventing a capacity
  from a nightly price would sell seats nobody confirmed.
- **Sellability is `null`, never `0`.** Every offer reports "the source did not
  say". `bookable: false` is the one negative signal Kiwi gives, and only that
  becomes a real zero.
- **No confirmed booking.** A Tequila price moves the number the shopper is
  quoted. It does **not** create a supplier reservation, because no supplier
  relationship exists behind it. Tequila is not an inventory holder and must not
  be presented as one.

Prices enter as `computeQuote`'s `basePriceCents` — a cost, never a retail price —
so platform markup, tax and fee stay owned by `modules/pricing`.

### Why SerpApi is configured but not wired

`SERPAPI_API_KEY` is read by `config/env.ts` so the credential can be added
without a code change, but no adapter consumes it yet. It returns Google Flights
and Google Hotels results by scraping Google. That is technically straightforward
and commercially unclean: it is not an authorised redistribution channel, and
nothing in this repo's licensing currently permits it. Wiring it is a business
decision, not a technical one — record the decision here first.

### trvl — zero-key, and the only source measured to return real prices

`MikkoParkkola/trvl` (MIT, `v1.25.0`, cosign-signed single binary). Found via
`github.com/topics/flight-search`, after an earlier pass over the obvious names
had wrongly concluded nothing usable existed.

Measured on 2026-10-05 against the real binary:

```text
$ trvl flights JFK LHR 2026-11-15 --format json
  { "success": true, "count": 125,
    "flights": [{ "price": 244.64, "currency": "EUR",
                  "provider": "skiplagged", "legs": [...] }] }

$ trvl hotels "Tokyo" --checkin 2026-11-15 --checkout 2026-11-18 --format json
  { "count": 123, "total_available": 2428,
    "hotels": [{ "price": 42.37, "nightly_price": 42.37,
                 "taxes_and_fees": 23.91, "room_types": [...],
                 "image_url": "https://pix8.agoda.net/..." }] }
```

Prices vary by date on the same route (186.60 / 244.64 / 258.92 EUR for Oct /
Nov / Jan), so this is a real price structure rather than a fixture. Hotels also
carry a usable image URL, which answers the product-media question without
storing image URLs against products.

Four limits, all measured:

- **24.6 s per invocation.** Fatal inside a request. It is wired as a *pre-warm*
  source: `trvl-warmer.ts` runs it on a schedule and writes Redis;
  `trvl-source.ts` only ever reads that cache. A miss returns `[]`, so the
  shopper sees the seeded price.
- **`--currency` does not work.** Asked for USD, GBP, AUD or JPY it returned EUR
  every time at an identical price. The repo has no FX table, and `pickOffer`
  deliberately refuses to convert, so only EUR-selling routes are warmed —
  288 of 676 ticket types. Adding conversion here would mean the platform
  quietly acquiring FX it has never had, in the one place designed to reject it.
- **Terms.** The README states it is a personal-use tool and that "automated
  access may violate some providers' Terms of Service — you are responsible for
  compliance in your jurisdiction." `TRVL_ENABLED` therefore defaults to false.
  Telemetry is disabled on the child process (`TRVL_NO_TELEMETRY=1`) rather than
  left to the operator's memory.
- **No cruise.** There is a `ground` command covering bus, train and ferry, but
  no cruise search.

End-to-end proof (warmer → Redis → resolver), on a real EUR flight:

```text
✓ cold read: null (falls back to seeded price)
✓ warm: wrote cache entry
✓ warm read: {"netPriceCents":40089,"currency":"EUR","fromCache":true}
```

Reproduce with `prisma/verify-trvl-warm.ts`.

### Rejected after inspection

- **LetsFG** (2110 stars) — the most active project found, and wrong for this
  platform. It is a consumer affiliate site: onboarding requires connecting a
  card through a 0.00 Revolut setup, `letsfg.co` is "human-only by default"
  behind Cloudflare Turnstile, and booking captures a payment from the shopper.
  That is the affiliate model this project explicitly is not.
- **flightclaw** — hosted MCP at `mcp.flightclaw.com`. Every path (`/mcp`,
  `/sse`, `/api`, `/docs`, `/openapi.json`) returns 401. Needs a key, so it is
  not the zero-key option it is advertised as.
- **stayingapi/hotel-api** — 3 stars, last pushed 2026-07.
- **aviasales-mcp** — 13 stars, GPL-3.0. Its upstream was probed directly:
  `api.travelpayouts.com/v1/prices/cheap` → 401, `/v2/routes/latest` → 404.
- **OctoTrip/flights** — repository exists; not wired because the flightclaw and
  LetsFG results showed this niche is dominated by credentialed or affiliate
  endpoints, and an unverified MCP server is not worth the audit cost.

### Cruise

**No source is available, and none is stubbed.** Google has no cruise aggregator,
trvl has no cruise command, and each operator (Royal Caribbean, MSC, Carnival…)
sells through its own agency channel. `CRUISE` prices come from
`TicketType.basePriceCents` and search says nothing false about them. This is a
known gap, not an oversight — a per-operator scraper would cost far more in
maintenance than the category currently earns.

### Open endpoints carry no commercial terms

Re-probed alongside the above, all reachable, none usable for rates:

```text
opensky-network.org/api/states/all  -> 200 (positions)
api.adsb.lol/v2/point/...            -> 503 at time of check
api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast      -> 200 (weather; no fare or allotment)
en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/...     -> 200 (descriptive content only)
```

Content-real-time work uses the last two. They inform what a product page *says*,
never what it *costs* or whether it can be sold.

### What the content sources cannot answer

Two limits were established by probing, and both constrain what "live content"
can mean here. Neither is a bug to be fixed later; they are properties of the
data.

**`/v2/callsign/{cs}` answers only aircraft airborne *right now*.** Re-probed
2026-10-04: `DAL112` returns `200` with `total: 0`. A 200 proves the endpoint
is reachable, not that it resolved a flight. Seeded, historical and synthetic
callsigns legitimately return empty, and empty is a valid answer, not a fault.
**A live position is therefore an enrichment, never a join key** — the platform
must not depend on one to render a product.

**`adsbdb` is keyed on registration, which the catalogue does not carry.**
`FlightSegment` has no `registration` column; it stores `aircraft` as an IATA
type code (`B77W`) and `flightNumber` on only 12 of 40 rows. `adsbdb` accepts
neither. It is a useful research tool for enriching a *known* airframe and
cannot enrich this catalogue.

Where the platform does carry usable keys, the realistic join is geographic:
`Product.latitude` / `longitude` are populated for all 34 `FLIGHT` products, so
`near()` is the only content path with a real join. Note that the seeded
`marketingCarrierCode` and `flightNumber` disagree (e.g. carrier `BA` on flight
`EK001`), so callsign construction from catalogue columns is not reliable either.

Verified quirks that shape the chain:

- **OpenSky's anonymous `/states/all` ignores its `callsign` parameter.** The
  2026-10-04 probe with `?callsign=DAL112` returned unfiltered global states
  (Utah, India), not the requested flight. A fallback that returns the wrong
  aircraft is worse than no fallback, so OpenSky does not participate in the
  by-callsign chain — `adsb-lol` serves it alone, and its `/v2/callsign/{cs}`
  endpoint was verified to filter correctly.
- OpenSky answers a bounding *square*; the API contract is a circle, so the
  adapter applies a great-circle filter after the bbox query.
- adsb.lol's `alt_baro` is feet *or* the string `"ground"` — the normaliser
  branches on the type rather than trusting the number.
- adsb.lol refuses the runtime's default `User-Agent` (`node`) with HTTP 403
  "User-Agent too generic; include valid contact info" (verified 2026-10-04).
  The adapter therefore sends a project-identifying UA on every request;
  without it the primary source is unreachable and every query silently
  degrades to OpenSky's anonymous quota.

Real-time positions never feed pricing or inventory. Schedule, fare and seat
inventory remain governed by the rule above: they cannot come from open data,
and the pricing/inventory engines derive them.

## Interface

`apps/api/src/modules/supply/source.ts` defines `SupplySource`. One adapter per row
above. `booking/*` never imports it.

## Inventory feed (batch scrape — Apify Expedia Hotels)

A fourth kind of source, and the only one that is **staged rather than sold**:
`jupri/expedia-hotels` returns real hotel rows, and they land in
`ScrapedInventory` where nothing is sellable until an operator promotes it by
hand (positioning option A — see `docs/adr/0001-inventory-feed-positioning.md`).
The dividing line still holds: the scraped **price** is stored as evidence and
never becomes a `TicketType.basePriceCents`.

Probed live on **2026-10-06** with a real token, per the freshness rule.

| finding | evidence |
| --- | --- |
| answers at all? | yes, once permitted — `POST /v2/acts/jupri~expedia-hotels/runs` |
| credentialed? | **token required**, owner-supplied (`APIFY_TOKEN`) |
| permission gate | `403 {"error":{"type":"full-permission-actor-not-approved", …}}` until the actor is approved in the console. Actor reports `actorPermissionLevel: FULL_PERMISSIONS` |
| input shape | `site` must be a **numeric portal id** (`"1"`, `"4"`, `"8"`, `"20"`, …), not a hostname: `Field input.site must be equal to one of the allowed values: "1", "3", …`. `location` is an array; `limit` is per query |
| **reliability** | the actor's own 30-day stats: `SUCCEEDED 29 / TOTAL 27214` = **0.107%** |
| **what a call costs** | billed per platform usage (residential proxy traffic), **not per row**. A 12-attempt hunt cost **$0.00060** total |
| failure mode | `☢️ Proxy: <…RESIDENTIAL…> (REQUIRED)` then `❌ HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests` — Expedia rate-limits the actor's **shared residential proxy group**. Measured **12/12 failed**, then **4/4 failed again** on a re-probe of the actor's own documented example input (`{"location":["Bali"],"limit":5}`) |
| currency | the Expedia US portal (`site: "1"`) answers **USD**, which matches settlement |

### Input schema (from the actor's published schema, cross-checked with probes)

| input | notes |
| --- | --- |
| `location` | **array**. Accepts a place name (`"Bali"`), `"region:<id>"`, coordinates (`"36.778259,-119.417931"`), or space-separated Expedia/Hotels.com hotel ids |
| `limit` | results **per query** |
| `check_in` / `check_out` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `site` | **region + currency**, as a numeric portal id (`"1"` = Expedia US/USD). Validated upstream; a hostname is rejected |
| `language` | locale, e.g. `en_US` |
| `includes:*` | extra blocks: `description`, `policies`, `amenities`, `gallery`, `faq`, `location`, `landmarks`, `offers` (room prices), `calendar`, `availability` (integer = months ahead), `review`, `review_count`. Each costs upstream traffic |
| `dev_proxy_config` | **the escape hatch** — an HTTP(S)/SOCKS5 proxy object. Supplying your own egress is the only documented way around the `429` above |

Wired accordingly: `APIFY_HOTEL_SITE`, `APIFY_HOTEL_LANGUAGE`, `APIFY_HOTEL_INCLUDES`,
and `APIFY_HOTEL_PROXY_CONFIG` (a JSON passthrough — the exact object shape is not
documented, so this code does not guess it).

Raw log lines from the failed hunt (verbatim):

```text
☢️ Proxy: <http://groups-RESIDENTIAL@10.0.93.255> (REQUIRED)
❌ HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests
```

Consequences encoded in the adapter:

- **An empty or failed batch is a normal outcome, not an error.**
  `ingestApifyHotels` returns `fetched: 0` and never throws on an empty dataset.
- **`ingestCityBatch` retries each city** and reports `perCity`, because one
  request in a thousand is not a viable population strategy.
- **The scraped `priceCents` is evidence.** Never read by `computeQuote`;
  `promoteScrapedRow` requires an operator-typed `costCents`.
- **PII is stripped on the way in.** Reviewer identity never reaches `raw`.

Because the feed is unreliable, this is an **operator-populated** staging table
(`INVENTORY_FEED_ENABLED=false` by default; the routes 404 while off), not a
production supply channel. The index layer reads `ScrapedInventory` directly
(trigram indexes in `prisma/indexes.sql`), so any row that does land is
searchable with no separate pipeline.

## Credential classification

> 实时数据方案必须同时审计"数据获取凭证"和"交易凭证"，两者不能混为一谈。
>
> A live-data plan must audit **data-access** credentials and **transaction**
> credentials separately; the two must never be conflated.

Reading a price and being able to sell at it are different powers, held under
different contracts. Treating "we have an API key" as "we can take money" is how
a platform ends up promising a booking it cannot fulfil. Every source is
therefore classified by **what its credential authorises**, weakest first:

| class | authorises | transacts? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC` | nothing — the bytes are open to anyone | no |
| `API_KEY` | identifies a caller **for data access**. No commercial right over the data | no |
| `SUPPLIER` | a supplier relationship returning **real** inventory/prices — still a *read* power | no |
| `BOOKING` | authority to create a **real reservation upstream** (a write against someone else's inventory) | **yes** |
| `SETTLEMENT` | authority to **move real money** (charge, capture, refund, payout) | **yes** |

The registry is code, not prose: `apps/api/src/modules/supply/credentials.ts`.
`pnpm credentials:contract` (inside `pnpm verify`) asserts every claim below.

### Per-source audit (2026-10-06)

| source | domain | class | enabled | can book | can settle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ourairports` | content | `PUBLIC` | ✅ | – | – |
| `wikipedia-content` | content | `PUBLIC` | ✅ | – | – |
| `overture-places`, `osm-pois` | content | `PUBLIC` | – | – | – |
| `adsb-lol`, `opensky-network` | position | `PUBLIC` | ✅ | – | – |
| `trvl` | flight | `PUBLIC` | – | – | – |
| `kiwi.tequila` | flight | `API_KEY` | – | – | – |
| `serpapi` | flight | `API_KEY` | – | – | – |
| `amadeus` | flight | `API_KEY` + `SUPPLIER` | – | – | – |
| `apify.expedia-hotels` | hotel | `API_KEY` + `SUPPLIER` | ✅ | – | – |
| `cruise` | cruise | `SUPPLIER` + `BOOKING` | – | – | – |
| `hyperswitch` | payment | `SETTLEMENT` | – | – | ✅ |
| `paypal` | payment | `SETTLEMENT` | – | – | ✅ |
| `crypto-trc20` | payment | `SETTLEMENT` | – | – | ✅ |

"enabled" is `available`: the credential is present and usable **for a read** in
the current deployment. It is the line between *"we documented it"* and *"we
turned it on"*. The three settlement rails are classed `SETTLEMENT` and all three
are **disabled** — the audit lists them precisely because a real integration
would need them, which is not the same as having them.

### Stage transaction boundary

> 本项目可以使用：公开实时数据 · 第三方实时数据 API · 用于读取实时价格/库存的供应商 API Credential

This stage is bounded to **read-only supply**:

- **Permitted:** `PUBLIC`, `API_KEY`, and a `SUPPLIER` credential used to
  **read** live price/inventory.
- **Not permitted:** `BOOKING` and `SETTLEMENT`. No real reservation is created
  upstream and no real money moves.

The boundary is a value (`STAGE_BOUNDARY`), not a paragraph, so the contract gate
can enforce it: **no source with an enabled credential may book or settle**, and
the settlement adapters **refuse `live`** rather than merely lacking config.

### Payment rails added this stage (modelled, sandbox-only)

`CARD`, `PAYPAL` and `CRYPTO_TRC20` are modelled as account-saveable methods, and
`PaymentMethod` stores **only a gateway token, a brand and the last four digits** —
never a PAN, expiry or CVC. That rule is enforced: the Prisma model has no such
columns and the API schema has no such field.

Because the boundary admits no live settlement credential, the PayPal and TRC20
adapters ship **sandbox-only** and refuse `live` outright (`live_rail_out_of_scope`)
— a refusal is louder and more honest than an adapter that silently pretends to
have settled. TRC20 additionally checksum-validates Tron addresses (base58check),
because an on-chain transfer is irreversible and a typo is a loss.

Account centre: `GET /api/v1/account/overview`, `GET|POST /api/v1/account/payment-methods`,
`PATCH|DELETE /api/v1/account/payment-methods/:id`, `GET /api/v1/account/payment-channels`.
Support may list, set-default and **remove** a customer's saved method, but never
add one — a support agent must not be able to introduce a payment credential.

## Inventory feed — actor reliability and the offline path (re-probed 2026-10-07)

`jupri/expedia-hotels` is the wired `APIFY_HOTEL_ACTOR`. It was re-probed live on
**2026-10-07** because the freshness rule above requires it, and the results are
quoted verbatim because the difference between them is the whole story:

| probe | input | observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| city search | `{location:["Las Vegas"],limit:3,site:"1",language:"en_US",check_in:"2026-11-15",check_out:"2026-11-18"}` | run **FAILED**, `statusMessage: "error: Too Many Requests"`, exitCode 1, **0 items**, 15.3 s |
| hotel id | `{location:["ho138881"],limit:1,site:"1",language:"en_US"}` | run **SUCCEEDED** in 5.2 s but **0 items** |
| dataset read | `GET /v2/datasets/{id}/items` | `[]` — the run genuinely produced no rows |

**Cause.** The actor's default egress is Apify's **shared residential proxy group**,
which Expedia rate-limits across every user of the actor — not something this repo
can fix by retrying. This is the same finding as the recorded 12/12 `HTTP 429` and
the actor's own 30-day success rate of **29/27,214 (0.107%)**. The id probe did not
429 only because it produced no search traffic; `location` is also not the field
for a hotel id, and the schema's `example` enum hints the id forms belong to a
different entry point.

**Fix (operator action, already wired).** The actor exposes `dev_proxy_config`
(HTTP(S) or SOCKS5; documented only as a URL format, `type: object` with no
published shape). Supply your own egress and the 429 disappears:

```bash
APIFY_HOTEL_PROXY_CONFIG='{"useApifyProxy":false,"proxyUrls":["socks5://user:pass@host:9000"]}'
APIFY_HOTEL_SITE=1          # numeric portal id; "1" is Expedia US, answering in USD
```

**Offline path — so the pipeline is exercisable without any upstream.**
`pnpm inventory:fixture` stages a stored sample
(`apps/api/prisma/fixtures/expedia-hotels.sample.json`) through the *same*
normaliser and the *same* staging helper the live path uses, labelled
`fixture:expedia-hotels` so a staged row never claims to have been fetched. It
writes **only** `ScrapedInventory`, exactly like the live ingest.

Measured on 2026-10-07: `fetched: 6, inserted: 4, skipped: 2` (a row with no `id`
and a row with no `name` are skipped, never guessed), and the catalogue was
unchanged at `230 products / 676 ticket types`.

**One step that is easy to miss.** A promoted row lands as `DRAFT` with **no
inventory** — `promote.ts` deliberately refuses to invent stock from a nightly
snapshot. Search only lists products with a bookable date, so an operator must
**seed `InventoryRecord` rows before the promoted product can be found**. Without
that step the product is indexed yet unfindable, which is the failure the
integration check now asserts against:

```text
pnpm --filter @easytrip/api inventory:integration
  ✓ the promoted product is discoverable in search — engine=postgres total=1
  ✓ the search hit carries the operator price, not the scraped one — =24900
```

Full chain, all offline: `pnpm inventory:fixture` (stage) → promote via
`/admin/inventory-feed` (needs `INVENTORY_FEED_ENABLED=true`) → seed inventory →
publish → the existing search serves it. `pnpm inventory:contract` and
`pnpm inventory:integration` carry the assertions; the former is inside
`pnpm verify`.
